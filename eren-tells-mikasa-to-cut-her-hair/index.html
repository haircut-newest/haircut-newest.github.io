<p>Eren�s reasoning is supposedly safety. The journey across the sea was the perfect moment for the two of them to express how they felt towards one another. She wears the scarf as a symbol of her connection to eren. That would have been so alpha. It was a sentiment of anger and frustration, and. And she cuts her hair.</p>

<p>Eren�s reasoning is supposedly safety. Shingeki no kyojin) is a japanese dark fantasy anime television series adapted from the manga of the same name by. Eren telling mikasa he hates her and beating up armin tacitly encourages his friends to fight him without holding back in attack on titan �s final battle. The journey across the sea was the perfect moment for the two of them to express how they felt towards one another.

<p>It’s simply going to be much easier to fight with no need to worry about your hair falling into your face. Eren does say to mikasa that he hates her at one point, mostly because she lacked the “freedom” he so vehemently fought for. Just want to point out that while cutting her hair short. I think that moment is there just to show how mikasa feels towards eren. The journey across the sea was the perfect moment for the two of them to express how they felt towards one another.</p>

<p>We see in ch 99 that she is even wearing a scarf similar to mikasa, and eren thought it was mikasa simply because she is the only asian he has ever seen and has no reason to think that.
